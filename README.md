Purpose
For many individuals—from students juggling coursework to full-time workers managing demanding schedules—the daily question of "what's for dinner?" is a significant source of stress. After a long day, the mental energy required to research recipes that specifically align with the random assortment of ingredients in their pantry is often nonexistent. This challenge highlights a frustrating gap: while most households possess a foundation of staples capable of creating a nearly infinite number of meals, the average person lacks the culinary expertise or time to envision these possibilities. The result is often wasted food, repetitive meals, or the costly and less healthy default of ordering takeout. This application helps create a list of possible meals that can be made with a given list of ingredients. This application expands the mind to many possibilities while saving the user time from strenuous research on what to make with what they have. Many people lack the time after a workday to do specific research or even the knowledge on specific meals, this application helps to tackle those issues and many more such as minimizing food waste through the efficient use of existing ingredients, it promotes both economic savings and environmental sustainability.

Restaurant Owners / Entrepreneurs 
Many restaurant owners run out of ingredients of customers’ favorite dishes fast, especially during lunch and dinner rush hours.

This is why our application will help these restaurant owners who had to 86’d an item and need to use the surplus ingredients remaining to make different dishes.
